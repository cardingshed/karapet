bridge tools quantifying luck

This is a collection of free, open-source tools in Python for the card game bridge.
Statistical methods are employed by authorities to help distinguish between luck and cheating.
This repository is intended to help players, investigators and any accused understand and independently perform such methodology.

Included as submodules:
Redeal by Antony Lee which is a
Python implementation of Thomas Andrew's Deal program and Bo Haglund's Double Dummy Solver.
The deal and DDS programs are well-established standards, widely adopted for example by national bridge organisations globally.

PoiBoi by Mike Straka https://github.com/tsakim/poibin which is a
Python implementation of the Poisson Binomial probability distribution.
A test statistic used by the EBU follows the [Poisson Binomial probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_binomial_distribution)
