### bridge tools quantifying luck

Statistical methods are employed by authorities to help distinguish between *luck* and *cheating*.  <br>
This is a collection of free, open-source tools in Python for the card game bridge.  A test statistic used by
the EBU follows the [Poisson Binomial probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_binomial_distribution) and a Python
implementation of this is also included as a submodule.

### included as submodules:
-[Redeal](https://github.com/anntzer/redeal) by Antony Lee <br>
    
    Python implementation of Thomas Andrew's Deal program and Bo Haglund's Double Dummy Solver.
    The deal and DDS programs are well-established standards, widely adopted for example by national bridge organisations globally.

-[PoiBoi](https://github.com/tsakim/poibin) by Mike Straka  <br>
    
    Python implementation of the Poisson Binomial probability distribution.
